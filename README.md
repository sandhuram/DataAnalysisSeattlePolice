# DataAnalysisSeattlePolice
Performed targeted data analyses using descriptive statistics. 
Created and Implemented Predictive Model based on list of crimes in Seattle by frequency, predicting “Higher” or “Lower” Crime Urgency.

This is the code that I used to analyze the "Seattle Police 911 Incident Response".

The SeattlePoliceAnalysis.py is very unstructured. 
Mostly should be in reference for how to navigate Pandas or encode variables in sci-kit learn.
